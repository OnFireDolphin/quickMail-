# quickMail-
So this project is composed of two main applications:
One of those applications will be available for users and it will be a simple graphic interface. The graphic interface is developed in a different repository that you can find here <a href="https://github.com/markbekhet/quickMail-client-frontend">here</a>. The user can enter his preferences using this interface. More information are in the README of the repository

The second application is run through a server: it consits of two main parts
The first part will be web scrapping the web to see today's news and it will send an array to the other part of the application. This second part will interact with the database and send the emails to the users depending on their preferences
